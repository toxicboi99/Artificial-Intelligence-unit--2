## 🧠 **1. Introduction to AI Search Algorithms**
Search algorithms in AI help in decision-making, pathfinding, and problem-solving by exploring possible solutions efficiently.

## 🔍 **2. Uninformed Search Algorithms**
Uninformed search algorithms operate **without domain knowledge** and explore the search space systematically.

### 📌 Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explores nodes level by level.
- Uses a **queue (FIFO)**.
- Guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### 📌 Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Explores deep paths before backtracking.
- Uses a **stack (LIFO)**.
- Memory-efficient but may not always find the shortest path.

### 📌 Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Expands the least-cost node first.
- Suitable for weighted graphs.
- Uses a priority queue.

### 📌 Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
- Combines the benefits of DFS and BFS.
- Uses depth-limited searches to gradually increase depth.

---

## 🧠 **3. Informed Search Algorithms**
These algorithms use **heuristics** to improve search efficiency.

### 📌 Best-First Search
- Expands the most promising node based on a heuristic.
- Faster but not always optimal.

### 📌 A* Algorithm (A-Star)
- Uses: **f(n) = g(n) + h(n)**.
- Guarantees the optimal path if heuristics are admissible.
- Used in pathfinding and robotics.

### 📌 AO* Algorithm (And-Or Search)
- Used in AND-OR search graphs.
- Solves problems with **sub-goals and multiple dependencies**.

### 📌 Greedy Best-First Search
- Selects the node with the lowest heuristic value.
- Faster but may not find the optimal path.

### 📌 Hill Climbing Algorithm
- Continuously moves towards the direction of increasing value.
- Risk of getting stuck in **local maxima**.

### 📌 Simulated Annealing
- Introduces randomness to escape local maxima.
- Used in **optimization problems**.
